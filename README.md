# Engage 2017 CD workshop

This repository contains demo code for the Acquia Engage 2017 CD workshop. There are several branches, with each branch corresponding to a tutorial in the Pipelines Examples repository: https://github.com/acquia/pipelines-examples

This tutorial demonstrates the simplest possible usage of Acquia Pipelines. The Pipelines YAML file simply creates a plain-text file, hello.txt, containing the text "Hello, Pipelines."
